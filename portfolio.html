      <font size="+1"><figcaption>Our app is an app that helps preschoolers learn how to count and learn the alphabet. The above screenshot shows our counting section of the app. Basically the kids are given a picture of various numbers of pandas and they have to click the "answerpicker" in order to pick the correct answer. If they are click the right answer the "correct label" says good job and the picture changes to another picture of pandas. However, if the kids get it wrong the "correctlabel" says try again and the kids cannot move on until they have the right answer! The same thing happens for the alphabet but imstead the kids are given an object and they have to figure out the letter that the object starts with!</figcaption></font>
